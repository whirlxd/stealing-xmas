        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 1: Embrace Your Inner Grinch</h2>
            <p>Before you can steal Christmas, you must channel your inner Grinch. Practice your scowl in the mirror and perfect your "Bah, humbug!" It's all about the attitude!</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Green face paint is optional but highly recommended for authenticity.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 2: Plan Your Heist</h2>
            <p>Every good Christmas caper needs a solid plan. Will you slide down chimneys? Sneak through pet doors? The choice is yours, but remember: stealth is key!</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: A detailed map of Whoville (or your neighborhood) can be quite handy.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 3: Disguise Yourself</h2>
            <p>A convincing Santa costume is crucial for your Christmas-stealing success. Don't forget the beard – the fluffier, the better!</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Practice your "Ho Ho Ho" laugh, but make it sound slightly evil.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 4: Gather Your Tools</h2>
            <p>Every Grinch needs the right equipment. A large sack for presents, a silent sled, and perhaps some night-vision goggles will serve you well.</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Don't forget treats to distract any guard dogs (or reindeer(s))!</div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 5: Execute Your Plan</h2>
            <p>As you sneak about on Christmas Eve, remember to be quiet as a mouse. Grab those presents, snatch those stockings, and don't forget the roast beast!</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Leave a small onion in place of each cookie and watch the children cry.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 6: The Great Escape</h2>
            <p>With your bag full of Christmas cheer, make your daring escape back to your lair. Watch out for any curious children or suspicious pets!</p>
            <div class="tip">Tip: Have a getaway carol prepared in case you need to blend in with carolers.</div>
